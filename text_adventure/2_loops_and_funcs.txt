1) Using your knowledge of loops add in the appropriate loop to prevent the player from entering invalid data for various selections
2) Using your knowledge of functions, split your code up into appropriate functions to remove redundancy/repetition as well as clean up your code
3) Add the following variables that will be used to keep track of player stats:
    * HP (Hit points)
    * MP (Mana points)
    * Level
4) Using your knowledge of functions, creating the following:
    * A function that reduces the player's hit points
    * A function that reduces the player's mana points
5) Using your knowledge of loops, add a menu that is shown to the player after the game's introduction that:
    * Contains 3 options (for now):
        * Damage HP (This should use the function you created earlier)
        * Reduce MP (This should use the function you created earlier)
        * Quit (This should exit the game. HINT: Think of while loops)
    * Requires to player to enter a number corresponding to a menu option, i.e. (1, 2, 3)
    * If a player enters a value that is not a valid menu option, the following should occur:
        * The menu should re-display
        * An error message should display beneath the menu letting the player know they entered an invalid value
        * The player should be able to enter another value until they quit the game

NOTES:
    * This assignment is out of 100%.
    * For this assignment, do not worry about how to 'save' any of the data as we have not learnt about this yet.
    * Extra marks will be given for concise and well named variables.
    * Extra marks will be given for proper and well thought storage of variables.
        (correct variable type/not repeating information)
    * Marks will be deducted for uncommented code
    * Marks will be deducted for general messy code.
