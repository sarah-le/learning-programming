1) Create an introduction for your text adventure.
    This could be something along the lines of the setting or any other narrative you wish.

2) Using variables print your introduction to the would-be player to introduce them to your world.

3) Ask the player a variety of questions about their adventurer, including (but not limited to):
    * Name (Marks will depend on how efficiently you store it)
    * Where they hail from (their town)
    * Race (Must also have at least 3 to choose from)
    * Their gender (you can have as many choices as you like)
    * Class (Must have exactly 3 to choose from)
    * What sort of advanced class they aspire to be (must have exactly 6 to choose from, 2 for each base class)
    
4) Using the information gathered, form a sentence that begins the story of their adventure with all of the details listed above.

NOTES:
    * This assignment is out of 100%.
    *For this assignment do not worry about the player inputing invalid data such as:
        * Weird length names or town names.
        * Not entering one of the class/advanced class/gender options listed.
        We will learn how to prevent this in the near future.
    * For this assignment, do not worry about how to 'save' any of the data as we have not learnt about this yet.
    * Extra marks will be given for concise and well named variables.
    * Extra marks will be given for proper and well thought storage of variables.
        (correct variable type/not repeating information)
    * Marks will be deducted for uncommented code 
        (it is very important to explain what code is doing to someone new to your codebase.
        This does not mean you need to explain how a statement works, but what it is trying to achieve.)
    * Marks will be deducted for general messy code.
    * Marks will be deducted if your story has little to no effort placed into it (it's not hard to try)
